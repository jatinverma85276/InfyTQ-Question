Implement a program to find out whether a number is a seed of another number.
A number X is said to be a seed of number Y if multiplying X by its every digit equates to Y.
E.g.: 123 is a seed of 738 as 123*1*2*3 = 738


class Tester {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// Implement your code here 
		int num = 123;
		int text = num;
		int seed = 738,sum=num;
		while(num>0){
		    int r = num%10;
		    sum *= r;
		    num = num/10;
		}
		if(seed == sum){
		    System.out.println(text +" is a seed of "+seed);
		}else{
		    System.out.println(text +" is not a seed of "+seed);
		}
	}
}
